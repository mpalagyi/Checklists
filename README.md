# Checklists

I'm sick of maintaining camping and hiking checklists in 3rdParty software when straight Markdown files will do.

- [Back Packing/Hiking](BackPacking.md)
- [Bike Packing](BikePacking.md)
- [Mountain Biking](MountainBiking.md)

## Building PDFs from the Markdown Checklists

```sh
yarn install
yarn run build
```
